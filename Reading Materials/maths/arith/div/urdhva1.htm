<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; We've already seen the 'Nikhilam' method for dividing
two numbers. That method satisfies one of the criteria&nbsp; of the Indian methods, namely
mental calculation. But the drawback is that, it is not general. That method was best
suited only when the divisor was large. We now present you a method of division, which is
general, fast and also can be done mentally.This method is called <em>Urdhva Tiryaka </em>or
Straight Division. Let's illustrate this with an example.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Consider the division of&nbsp; 47971 by 84:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Write the dividend and divisor using the following rules:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Write&nbsp; the units digit of the divisor (4) to the left of dividend. We write the
&nbsp; tens&nbsp; digit of the divisor (8) to the bottom of 4. The entire process of
division will only involve the tens digit of the divisor, namely 8.<br>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We then start finding&nbsp; the quotient digits from left to right
.&nbsp; This is done by dividing 47 by 8 and writing the quotient and the
remainder. Let's represent the quotient by Q and the remainder by R. Q gives the tens
digit of the quotient.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="Examples/step02.gif" alt="step02.gif (2135 bytes)"
width="500" height="150"><strong><br>
</strong>We then prefix the remainder 7 of the previous step to the next digit of the
dividend, i.e. 9, to get the partial dividend as 79 (which is nothing but multiplying 7 by
10 and adding 9). From this we further subtract the product of the previous quotient digit
and the first digit of the divisor, (5 x 4), to get 59 as the partial dividend. Divide
this 59 by 8 to get 7 as the quotient and 3 as the remainder.</font></p>

width="500" height="150"></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now our new partial dividend is 37 - 4 x 7 which is 9.
Dividing 9 by 8 yields a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1. <br>
<img src="Examples/step04.gif" alt="step04.gif (2384 bytes)" width="500" height="150"></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our next partial dividend is (11 - 4),&nbsp; which is 7. But
the last digit of the dividend corresponds to the remainder. Hence the remainder is 7</font></p>

width="500" height="150"></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thus the quotient is 571 and the remainder is 7. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Suppose you &nbsp;want to get the&nbsp;&nbsp; quotient&nbsp;
as a decimal number, we proceed as follows. Add zeroes to the dividend depending on the
precision (number of decimal places) you want. Then perform the steps&nbsp; as
usual.&nbsp; In the above example, if you want a precision of 2 digits after the decimal
point, append a zero to the end, to make the dividend as 479710. Instead of taking 7 as
the remainder, take it as the partial dividend, and repeat the steps. The next two steps
are, </font></p>

<p><img src="Examples/step06.gif" width="500" height="150" alt="step06.gif (1529 bytes)"></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hence, the final value is 571.08. This can be extended to
any no. of decimal places by adding zeroes to the dividend. Let's see a few more&nbsp; <a

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thus, the process involves only multiplication, addition and
division by a single digit divisor. At any stage we compute the partial dividend by
prefixing the previous remainder to the next digit of the dividend and subtract a value
from it. <a href="urdhva4.htm">What to do if the partial dividend becomes negative?</a></font></p>
