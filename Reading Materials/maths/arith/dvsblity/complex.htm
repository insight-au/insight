Better Techniques</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">The cases encountered so far had dealt only with
small divisors and hence small osculators. However there are techniques to deal with
bigger numbers. The bigger divisors can be grouped under 2 categories.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">Here we can drop two 9's. Note that for the 9's to
be dropped, they should occur in the <em><u>last</u></em> few digits of the number, and
they should be <em><u>Continuous</u></em>. The <em>Ekadhika </em>is 2, obtained by
dropping the 9's and adding a 1 to the result. Since two 9's were dropped, this number is
denoted by P<sub>2</sub>. The number 69492392 is not taken as such. Instead it is grouped
into numbers of two digits each (Since two 9's were dropped ) and used. (ie) 69492392
becomes 69 49 23 92. The usual method is carried out.</font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#9F7C4D" face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">2) <u>Divisors That Do Not
Fall Under The Category Above:</u></font></strong></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">For Divisors that do not fall into the above
category, We multiply them with suitable numbers to obtain numbers that end with a series
of 9's or ending with a series of zeros followed by a 1. (eg) <em>What is the osculator
for 857 ?</em></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">It can be observed that 857 x 7 = 5999. <em>Ekadhika
</em>of 5999 is 6. 6 is used for determining divisibility. But there is one important
modification. It should be observed that we are actually testing the divisibility by 5999
instead of 857. So if the numerator is not divisible by 7, even if it is divisible by 857,
the end result will not be divisible by 5999. This can be adjusted by testing the end
number for divisibility by 857 instead of 5999.</font></p>
