<p align="left"><font face="MS Serif" size="4"color="000000">The above verse states that there are 14
domains of knowledge. These areas are considered to be all-encompassing and give an
explanation for all the events that occur around us. These are the <em>Vedas</em> (<em>Rigveda,
Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda</em> ),<em> Meemamsa</em>&nbsp; (a discussion on the
vedas), <em>Nyaya</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (logic), <em>Puranas</em> ( of which there are 18
), <em>Itihasa </em>( the Ramayana and the Mahabharata).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="MS Serif" size="4"color="000000">The <em>Vedas </em>themselves have 6 angas
or parts. These are <em>Shiksha </em>(the pronunciation of the Vedas), <em>Chandas</em>
&nbsp; (prosody), <em>Vyakaranam</em> (grammar), <em>Jyotisham</em>&nbsp; ( astronomy), <em>Niruktam</em>
&nbsp; (the meanings of words) and <em>Kalpa</em>&nbsp; (the rules for the performance of
rituals).</font></p>

    target="_parent">Indian Mathematics</a></font><br>
    <font color="#000000">All of us are very fond of getting to the finish line in the easiest
    way possible. Be it in going from one place to another or in solving a problem, we would
    always like to take the shortest route possible. Arithmetic, in the Indian way, abounds
    with such shortcut methods and mental calculations. There has also been tremendous work
    done in the fields of algebra, geometry and trigonometry - so much so that most of what we
    see in our textbooks today, is only an offshoot of the work our ancestors did. This
    portion is considered to be a part of <em>Jyotisham</em><br>
    <br>

Tarka
    Shaastra</a></font><br>
    </font><font face="MS Serif" size="4" color="#000000">Logical reasoning is the most
    special among all of man's different faculties. He observes, interacts and arrives at
    conclusions. It is that ability which sets him apart from all other beings. He has always
    wished to know about the things around him, the way they work and why they work the way
    they do. Tarka Shaastra, which is&nbsp; a branch of <em>Nyaya</em> ,&nbsp; was the science
    in which a complete understanding of the universe was attempted. Rules were specified for
    classifying all that we see around us and for inferring other rules from their behaviour. </font><br>

Indian Astronomy</a></font><br>
    </a></font><br>
    </font><font face="MS Serif" size="4" color="#000000">Our fascination with the sky would
    have begun right from that age, when our parents would have pointed out to us, the silvery
    moon, in their endeavours to feed us. &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star .... Like a
    diamond in the sky&quot; goes a popular nursery rhyme, and several poets have written
    verses eulogising the sky and the stars. But there is so much of science and mathematics
    behind the beautiful facade of a clear night's sky. Astronomy(<em>Jyotisham</em>)had been
    a great strength of ancient Indian scientists and they accomplished a great deal in this
    area. Many astronomical observatories existed in earlier times and most mathematicians
    were also astronomers. </font><br>

    href="chhandas/index.htm">Chhandas</a></font><br>
    <font color="#000000">All of us enjoy good rhythmic music, or for that matter, any verse
    that is recited in the musical way that it should be. Chhandas is the domain of rhythms and
    metres, which emphasises the occurrences of different patterns in 'shlokas'. Combinatorial
    mathematics plays an important role in Chhandas. <br>

  <li><font face="MS Serif" size="4"><font color="#FF0000"><a
href="grammar/index.htm">Vyakaranam</a></font><br>
    <font color="#000000">Vyakaranam means 'grammar'. This section examines the necessity for
    a grammar, and how effective it is, in getting across what we want to say, in as simple a
    way as possible. This section also does a comparison of Indian grammar (Tamil &amp;
    Sanskrit) and English grammar, stressing on the need for precision and clarity in
    expression. There exist different rules for different grammars, all put forth in a concise
    fashion. </font></font></li>
