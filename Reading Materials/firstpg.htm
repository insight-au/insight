We present to you a glimpse of the Indian scientific tradition that has been in existence for long. Our objective is to create an awareness about the spirit of this legacy and to encourage you to explore and understand its relevance to the current day. There are so many basic aspects of Indian science that have been lost in the buzz of modern science. But one should realise that these fundamental aspects of Indian science were so popular and widespread those days that even laypersons knew to work their way with them. They were not the prerogative of experts alone. Insight presents to you such aspects of Indian science.
