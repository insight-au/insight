)</big></big></font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Straying is a tactic which many use when the going gets
tough in an argument. A trivial example for straying is </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; 'It will rain today, because today is a Sunday '</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Obviously, such an argument is illogical. Hence according to
the 'Tarka Shastra' straying is considered to be a flaw in reasoning. Moreover it
classifies straying into three categories. Let's briefly see each of them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><big>i) Common straying ( </big></font><strong><font FACE="Xdvng">s:aD:arN: s:vy:eB:c:ar hðt:Ø</font></strong><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><big>):</big></font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Consider the following argument:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#400080">'Mountain has fire because it (mountain) can
be seen'</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">At the first look, you can sense that the argument is
illogical. Where does it stray from the facts? Even a lake, where fire can't coexist, can
be seen. Thus the reason ('can be seen') holds good even for an instance (lake) where the
thing to be proved is absent. Such reasoning is called common straying</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><a href="comstray.htm">Some more examples of&nbsp; common
straying</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><big>ii) Uncommon straying ( </big></font><strong><font FACE="Xdvng">As:aD:arN: s:vy:eB:c:ar hðt:Ø</font></strong><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><big>
):</big></font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Let's look at another argument:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#400080"><em>'Sound is eternal because of soundness'</em></font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Here, eternality is the thing to be proved. We prove that by
citing the existence of soundness. Consider anything which is eternal, like space. You
can't find soundness in any such eternal things. Nor can you find soundness, in anything
which is not eternal (like a pen). Thus the reason cited is found, neither in some
instance which has the thing to be proved, nor in instances&nbsp; where the thing to be
proved is absent. Such a reason doesn't hold good, because it is unique to the given
instance. Such a reasoning is called 'Uncommon straying'.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><a href="uncomstr.htm">Some more examples of&nbsp; uncommon
straying</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><big>iii) Non - exclusive straying: ( )</big></font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">This is the final sub-division of straying. It can be
explained with the following argument:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#400080">'Everything is good because it is knowable'.</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Don't be baffled by usage of words like 'knowable'. If you
can perceive something, either directly or indirectly, then that thing is said to be
knowable. In the above argument, the instance considered is everything. Once you've
considered everything, there is nothing else left. Thus you can't find either a similar or
contradictory instance. Such an argument is called non-exclusive straying.</font></p>
