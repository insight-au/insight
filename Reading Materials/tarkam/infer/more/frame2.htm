<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>Vyaapti, as we have studied,
forms the nerve of inference. Hence, the recognition of vyaapti is very important for
sound inference. Usually, we take vyaapti to be a generalization of repeated instances of
the same kind. We see an event occurring repeatedly due to the same reason or two things
being co-existent wherever we see them. After we are convinced of their invariable
association, we identify the vyaapti. But we must be very careful in generalization. Care
must be taken to consider all possible instances and exceptions. Only when a
generalization is free of exceptions and suspicions, can we use it as vyaapti in
inference.&nbsp; </big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>An example will make things
clear:</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>One may observe a hundred times
that earthly substances can be scratched by metals. Still, in things like diamond, a
deviation to the above rule is observed (i.e., though diamond is a particular modification
of earth, no scratches can be caused by any metal on it. Only a diamond can scratch
another). Thus, vyaapti is to be interpreted as the knowledge of co-existence free from
fallacious knowledge (fallacious knowledge can be either certainty of a contrary fact or
mere suspicion).</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>Not only have our ancestors
given a way for using induction to identify vyaapti but also classified it into three
categories.They are:</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>1. Anvayavyatireki&nbsp; vyaapti
(positive-negative vyaapti)&nbsp; - Here, the hetu is both positively&nbsp; and negatively
related to the saadhya. That is, wherever hetu is found, saadhya is found. Wherever
saadhya is not found, hetu is not found. One can give examples both for the former and the
latter case.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>Example:</big></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><u><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big>Positive part:</big></font></u></p>
  <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big>Wherever there is smoke, there
  is fire. This is seen in the case of hearth.<br>
  </big></font></p>
  <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big>Here, the hetu (smoke) is
  positively related to the saadhya (fire). We can find an example for such a relation.
  Hearth is such an example.</big></font></p>
  <p><u><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big>Negative part:</big></font></u></p>
  <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big>Wherever there is no fire, there
  is no smoke. This is seen in the case of a lake.</big></font></p>
  <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big><br>
  Here, the hetu (smoke) is negatively&nbsp; related to the saadhya (fire). We can find an
  example for such a relation too. Lake is such an example.</big></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>2. Kevalaanvayi vyaapti (purely
positive vyaapti) - The hetu is always positively related to the saadhya. That is,
wherever hetu is found, saadhya is also found. But we can't find any example where saadhya
is not found. So, we <em><strong>can't</strong></em> &nbsp; assert that &quot;wherever
saadhya is not found, hetu is not found&quot;.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>Example:</big></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big>Consider the argument &quot;A
  jar is nameable because it is knowable like a pot&quot;. Sound's confusing doesn't it !
  &nbsp; Actually, something is called 'knowable' if&nbsp; it can be perceived. Something is
  'nameable' when we can attribute a name to it. </big></font></p>
  <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big>Here, the vyaapti is &quot; That
  which is knowable is also nameable&quot;. The hetu is the 'knowable' nature of the jar.
  Saadhya is the 'nameability' of the jar. There is a purely positive relation between the
  hetu and the saadhya. However, we can't come up with any example indicating the negative
  relation between the hetu and saadhya. That is, we can't say that &quot;That which is not
  nameable is not knowable&quot; because, everything in this world is nameable. </big></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>3. Kevalavyatireki vyaapti
(purely negative vyaapti) - The hetu is always negatively related to the saadhya. That is,
wherever saadhya is not found, hetu is not found. But we can't find any instance where
hetu is found. So we cannot say that &quot;wherever hetu is found, saadhya is also
found&quot;.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>Example:</big></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#000000"><big>Consider the argument &quot;Ram
  can't fly because he is a human being who doesn't have wings&quot;&nbsp; Here, the vyaapti
  is &quot;Human beings who don't have wings, can't fly&quot;. The relation between the hetu
  (Ram is a human being without wings) and the saadhya (Ram can't fly) is purely negative.
  That is, we can't say &quot;If human beings can fly, they'll have wings&quot; because, no
  human being can fly. </big></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>We know what paksha is. It is
the place where the saadhya is suspected. Two more terms associated with vyaapti and
paksha are 'sapaksha' and 'vipaksha'.&nbsp; We'll look at them.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#620062"><big>In case of our mountain example,
the mountain was the paksha. We cited the example of a hearth where the vyaapti between
smoke and fire is found. This is a positive instance. That is, there is certainty of the
saadhya (fire) and also the hetu (smoke). Hence, hearth is called 'sapaksha' or the
positive instance. Similarly, in case of a lake, we see the absence of fire and hence the
absence of smoke. Hence, the lake is called the negative instance or the vipaksha. Here,
we're certain that there is no fire. Hence, 'vipaksha' is one where the absence of the
saadhya is certain. </big></font></p>
