<p align="center"><font face="xdvng" size="6" color="#000000">AB:av:</font></p>
<font FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="2">

<p></font><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold" size="4" color="#000000">Absence</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">The final category is
negation or <i>Abhaava</i>&nbsp; (pronounced as a-bhaa-va)<br>
<br>
While others talk about existence of one or more characteristics abhaava talks about their
non-existence.<br>
The first six categories are positive while abhava is negative.<br>
Unlike the others which are regarded as absolute, abaava is relative in its conception. <br>
<br>
Absence of an object is different from the knowledge of its absence.<br>
It is this knowledge of the absence that is referred to as abhaavam.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">The <i>Vaishesika</i>,
being a realist, says that if one does not know that an object exists it doesn't mean that
the object doesn't exist.&nbsp; In other words the object exists, whether or not one knows
about it.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">For example, the
  electron existed even before its discovery.&nbsp; Only we didn't know about its existence.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Similarly, Knowledge of
negation is different from the thing negated.<br>
i.e. the thing negated is a substance or its quality but the knowledge of such negation is
abhaavam.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Non-existence is of four
kinds:<br>
<br>
1) Antecedent non-existence(<i>praagabhaava</i>)<br>
<br>
Praagabhaava is the non-existence of a thing before production.<i>&nbsp; Praagabhaava</i>
has no beginning but it has an end.<br>
For example, a pot does not exist before its production.&nbsp; We can talk about the
existence of the pot only after it has been created.<br>
Here beginning and end refers to the non-existence(abhaava) of the pot and not the
pot&nbsp; itself. This negation ends when the pot is produced. <br>
If <i>praagabhaava</i> is denied then existence of things would become beginningless.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">2) Subsequent
non-existence(<i>pradhvamsaabhaava</i>)<br>
<i><br>
Pradhvamsaabhaava</i> is the non-existence of a thing after its destruction.<i> </i>Pradhvamsaabhaava<i>
</i>has a beginning but has no end. <br>
For example, e.g. the pot does not exist after its destruction.<br>
<i>pradhvamsaabhaava </i>begins when the thing is destroyed and has no end since the same
thing cannot be produced again. <br>
If <i>pradhvamsaabhaava </i>is denied then things become everlasting.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">3) Absolute
non-existence(<i>atyantaabhaava</i>)<br>
<br>
Atyantaabhaava is the absence of things in the past, the present and the future. <i> </i>It
is both beginningless and endless. How can a thing be always absent? We'll explain this with an example. The absence of a pot in a room is an example of Atyantaabhaava. Don't be baffled by this statement. Let's make it a bit easy. In the room, the pot was never there in the past and it will not be there in the future. But what if some one places a pot there? When the pot is placed, it <i>hides the Atyantaabhaava.</i> Thus Atyantaabhaava has neither a beginning nor an end. But why should you have a such a concept? </font>
<font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">If <i>atyantaabhaava </i>is denied then
things would exist always and everywhere.<br>
</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">4) mutual non-existence(<i>anyonyaabhaava</i>)<br>
<br>
Anyonyaabhaava is the non-existence of a thing in presence of another.<i> </i>It is both
beginningless and endless. If <i>anyonaabhaava</i> is denied then all things would become
indistinguishable.<br>
e.g.Consider 2 objects - say a pot and a cloth. There is the absence of the pot in the cloth and similarly, the absence of the cloth in the pot. Thus there is an anyonyaabhaava (mutual non-existence) between the cloth and the pot.</font></p>
