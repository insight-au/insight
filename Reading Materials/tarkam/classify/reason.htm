Logic as you must be knowing, or atleast will be knowing shortly, is as old as the oldest
of sciences.&nbsp; Take a second off,&nbsp; and think how you came to know the world
around you,&nbsp; the way you know it today.&nbsp; In the first place, most of us would
say, 'Well, the people around us made us know it that way.&quot;&nbsp; And that's pretty
much the story.&nbsp;&nbsp; But was it pure data that was put into your mind?&nbsp; Of
course, not!&nbsp; Over the years not only did you learn to perceive things around you by
classifying them based on their&nbsp; hundred-million properties but you also developed
the ability to reason about&nbsp; their occurrence or their non-occurrence. This is
precisely what logic is. Thus you see, logic is something that comes to us naturally over
the years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4"><strong>Nyaaya Shastra</strong>&nbsp; is
that Indian science which deals with logic and reasoning.&nbsp; It has two schools of
thought - the nyaayaa and the vaisheShikaa. &nbsp; The founder of nyaayaa was sage <u>Goutama</u>
while the sage <u>KaNaada</u> founded vaisheShikaa.&nbsp; Together, these two are commonly
referred to as the nyaaya-vaisheshika system.This may be also be referred to as Tarka
Shastram</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Nyaaya-shastra is not the work of a
single person. &nbsp;It has evolved over time, as the outcome of constant contemplation by
many Indian logicians and thinkers.&nbsp; It aims to probe into the ultimate truth, by
exploiting our ability to reason things out.&nbsp; It perfects this innate ability in us,
with a certain set of rules and axioms. &nbsp;With this, we can analyse and understand
anything that we can think of. Moreover, the ingredient of this entire system is only <em>common
sense</em>. This helps us to understand things pretty easily.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4"><strong>'tarka-sangraha'</strong> is an
elementary work on nyaya-shastra that explains logic and reasoning in simple terms for the
layman. It contains the elements of both Nyaya and VaisheShika schools of thought. This
has been used as text for this course.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">As this course unfolds, we shall take a
two fold approach in studying tarkashastram.&nbsp; The first is <em>classification</em>
where&nbsp; we group things based on the similarity of their characteristics. &nbsp; It
can be similarities in terms of action they perform, the qualities they possess, etc.
&nbsp; Then we look into the various ways by which the above characteristics can be used
to arrive at a logical conclusion or otherwise referred to as <em>inferencing</em>. &nbsp;
Precisely what Sherlock Holmes uses to solve his cases !! Elementary.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Well with that
introduction, lets get into classification basics. </font></p>
