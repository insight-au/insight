Reasoning and Understanding</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Understanding the <em>unknown</em>
was like stepping into a blackhole. The Indian thinkers who had already done this saved us
from this trouble; they felt a comprehensive yet simple methodology was the need of the
day and postulated the following stages in pursuit of the unknown.</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000"><em>Perception and verbal
    testimony</em> (initial stage):</font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Perception is awareness
  of a thing or event through the senses; whatever one perceives is open to discussion. But
  Verbal testimony is that fact which is accepted without question. It comes from a reliable
  source, for example a teacher.<br>
  Axioms are typical examples of verbal testimony.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000"><em>Investigation of
    &nbsp; facts, correlation and discussion with the&nbsp; help of reasons</em> (second
    stage):</font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">The observations of the
  earlier stage go through a series of discussions and analyses.&nbsp; In these discussions
  one tries to reason out the cause and effect of such observations.&nbsp; The correct
  observations with the incorrect reasons are possible candidates for outright rejection.
  &nbsp; Only those observations that are supported by appropriate reasoning are accepted.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">'The sun appears to go
    around the earth causing day and night.'<br>
    The above statement is perfectly valid when it is the question of the observation.&nbsp; A
    person observing from earth obviously sees the sun going around the earth.<br>
    But this being a cause of day and nights is a false or an incorrect reason.<br>
    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000"><em>Contemplation leading
    to an inference</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; (third stage):</font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">The accepted
  observations and reasons are studied and constantly contemplated by the human mind to
  arrive at a logical conclusion.&nbsp; Once inferred this may be used in inferring other
  facts at a later date.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">What we have done in
classification is accomplishment of the second stage. Now that we have a method of
understanding the things around us , we have to correlate those things that we perceive
and those that we already know.&nbsp; This is where cognition comes into picture.</font></p>
