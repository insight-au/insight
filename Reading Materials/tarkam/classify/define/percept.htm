<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">This is something that we do in our day-to-day life
without any conscious effort. But have you ever tried to understand how we go about
perceiving things ? Or defining 'perception', for that matter? Let's give it a try! </font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Before we get on with the definition of 'perception'
let's understand a few basic terms. The connection between organs and objects is known as <strong>contact</strong>.
<strong>Organs</strong> can be any of the sense organs like eye, ear, nose, etc. And the <strong>objects</strong>
maybe anything that you come across like pot, jar, etc.! Perception is the result of this
contact., i.e., the apprehension of the contact of an organ with an object.&nbsp; It is
referred to as the special cause of apprehension.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">&nbsp; </font><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4"><strong>Types
of perception :<br>
</strong></font></u><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><br>
Perception is of two types - determinate and indeterminate.<strong><br>
Determinate : </strong>An apprehension is determinate if it helps to identify the
attributes of the object being observed. eg : &quot;That is a red rose&quot;. Here, the
red color is the attribute of the object (rose) that is being observed.<br>
<strong>Indeterminate :</strong> The knowledge in which there is absence of a subject, or
attribute, or relation between the object and the attribute is called indeterminate
knowledge. Eg : &quot;Something fishy is going on here.&quot;. Here, we can't determine
the nature of the &quot;fishy thing&quot;. </font></p>

<p><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4"><strong>Causes of perception :</strong></font></u></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Perception may be due to any one of the following kinds
of contact of organs with objects. We'll try and get them across, more through examples
than through complicated definitions: </font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><strong>1. The First Operative Cause: (Samyoga -
sannikarShah) <br>
</strong>This is just the raw perception of an object by an organ. This concerns just the
'contact' aspect. An example is the contact of a jar with the eye. </font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><strong>2. The Second Operative Cause: (Samyukta
Samavaaya ) <br>
</strong>To see that the jar has red color (of course assuming that you've taken a red
jar!) is what Samyukta Samavaaya is all about. This is brought about by the inherent union
of the red color with the object (the jar) that is perceived by the eye. </font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><strong>3. The Third Operative Cause:
(Samyukta-samaveta-samavaaya) <br>
</strong>In the jar example, the perception of the red color of the jar leads one to
perceive the fact that the jar <strong>has</strong> color. The cause for this perception
is the fact that red is a color. From this, we recognize that the
property of 'colorness' is inherently associated with the red color of the jar. </font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><strong>4. The Fourth Operative Cause: (Samavaaya
sannikarShah) <br>
</strong>To understand this, suppose that you hear a word. This happens by means of physical contact of the sound waves with the space that's present in the ear cavity. Unlike in the jar example, where the jar doesn't actually touch the eyes, here, the thing which we perceive (i.e, the word that we hear) touches the ear cavity. (It may be recalled that space is the medium of propagation of
sound.). For those who have trouble comprehending 'the space in the ear cavity', it is
perhaps a good approximation to think of it as the ear-drum (the tymphanic membrane) in
the ear. One may wonder how we perceive the words in a sound that originated at a far off
point. Such a perception is possible because the sound wave that starts gives rise to another wave, which in turns propel another and so on, till the last sound reaches the organ of hearing
in the ear. This is the same as the longitudinal waves that we come across in acoustics. </font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><strong>5. The Fifth Operative Cause:
(Samaveta-Samavaaya-sannikarShah) <br>
</strong>Continuing with the same example, this can be understood as the perception of the
fact that there is sound (i.e., 'soundness' or the genus of sound) because you just heard
a word. The word that you heard just now is one of the many possible sounds that you can
perceive. And the universal quality of 'soundness' is inherently associated with all these
sounds. This association causes the perception of 'soundness'. </font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><strong>6. The Sixth Operative Cause: (Visesana -
Visesyabhaava sannikarShah) <br>
</strong>This cause is operative in the perception of absence.&nbsp; Let's try and
understand this.<br>
What causes you to perceive that a jar is absent at a particular spot on the earth? Let's
consider the statement 'This spot on earth doesn't have the jar (i.e has the negation of
the jar).' Here negation of the jar is an attribute of the place in contact with the eye.
Now, if the jar had been there, then the jar would have been apprehended as existing at
that spot of the earth and its absence leads to non-perception of the jar. This
non-perception is due to contact between the eye and that particular spot of the earth.
This contact is the cause of the non-perception of the jar. It must be understood that the
non-perception of the jar is the perception of the jar's absence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Now that we have seen perception and classification,
let's move to inferencing.</font></p>
