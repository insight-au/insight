<P>We shall take a look at the moon and its motion in the sky in this section. The moon differs from the stars, in that its relative position with respect to the stars is not a constant. It may be recalled that the positions of the stars are fixed with respect to one another. The moon may be near Krittika one day, the next day near Rohini and so on. Even on a particular day it may be observed that the moon's position has changed compared to what it was, say a few hours ago. Like the Sun and the stars, the moon also moves along the eastern direction in the sky, in a day. </P>
<H3>Amavasya :</H3>
<P>Now, let go of all that stuff on where the moon goes and why it goes around like that! Have you noticed the way the moon's size changes? It is almost like the moon changes its size on will! Well, well, well. Not exactly. Here's the explanation. When you don't see the moon at all, then it means the day is an amavasya. (Hey, you don't see the moon not just because it is an amavasya day! The real fundae follows!). On an amavasya day, the sun and the moon are in the same direction (one below the other), as seen from the earth. This causes the portion of the moon in front of the earth not to be illuminated by the sun. The result - complete darkness for that side of the moon (Oh! poor dear!) when seen from the earth. After amavasya day, what to expect and why? Close your eyes (of course for a moment only!) and recollect what exactly you have observed and in which part of the sky (east, west, north, south, ...?!). </P>
