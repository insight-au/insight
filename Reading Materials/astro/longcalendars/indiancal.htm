<p><font color="#000000" size="4"face="tempus sans itc">You must have seen calendars 
  giving the months, the weekdays and the dates. If you want to find out the weekday 
  corresponding to some date in a particular month, you can find it out by looking 
  at the calendar. But the calendar you have come across is&nbsp; of only one 
  type (starting from January and ending in December). In general, a calendar 
  is a system of reckoning the beginning, the end and the divisions of the year.

<p><font color="#000000" size="4" face="tempus sans itc">People belonging to different lands and of different faiths have different types of calendars. In India there were two systems of
calendars namely</font></p>
<font color="#000000" size="4" face="tempus sans itc"> 
<p><font color="#000000" size="4">(i) luni-solar calendar and</font></p>

<font color="#000000" size="4"> 
<p><font size="4">Luni-solar system is followed in most regions of India.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0080" size="5">LUNI-SOLAR SYSTEM</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="4" face="tempus sans itc">In Luni-solar system, 
  months &amp; years are calculated from the moon's movement with respect to the 
  sun. There are two types of luni-solar calendars in existence. In Andhra, Karnataka, 
  Maharashtra and Gujarat one has the </font><font
color="#FF0080" size="4">Amanta system</font><font color="#000000" size="4">. 
  In this, the lunar month (Chandra maasa) begins with the tithi Pratipad of Sukla 
  paksha (the day after new moon) and ends with the next&nbsp; Amavasya. It is 
  called the Amanta system because it ends with an Amavasya. So, in Amanta system 
  the Chandra maasa begins when the angle between the sun and the moon is zero 
  and ends after it increases to 360</font><font
color="#000000" size="1"><sup><sup>o</sup></sup></font><font color="#000000" size="4">. 
  In the </font><font color="#FF0080" size="4">Poornimanta system </font><font color="#000000"
size="4">which is mainly followed in the North India, the month begins with the 
  tithi Pratipad of Krishna paksha (the day after full moon)&nbsp; and ends with 
  the next Poornima and hence the name. So, it starts when the angle between sun 
  and the moon is 180</font><font
color="#000000" size="1"><sup><sup>o</sup></sup></font><font color="#000000" size="4"> 
  and ends when it again becomes 180</font><font color="#000000" size="1"><sup><sup>o</sup></sup></font><font
color="#000000" size="4">. Chaitra Krishna paksha in the Poornimanta system corresponds 
  to Phalguna Krishna paksha in the Amanta system. <a name="chaitra"></a>But Chaitra 
  Sukla paksha means the same thing in both the systems. This is because Poornimanta 
  maasa begins with the Krishna paksha Pratipad but Amanta system begins with 
  the Sukla paksha Praatipad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  between the two systems</font></a></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="4">The year in Amanta system starts with tithi 
  Pratipad of &nbsp; Sukla paksha in Chaitra maasa and ends with the Phalguna 
  Amavasya. According to the nomenclature of the Poornimanta system, the year 
  in the Poornimanta system begins with the Chaitra Sukla Pratipad and ends with 
  the Chaitra Amavasya. Each lunar year is given a name: </font><font
color="#FF0080" size="4">Prabhava, Vibhava</font><font color="#000000" size="4">, 
  ... </font><font
color="#FF0080" size="4">Akshaya</font><font color="#000000" size="4">. There 
  are 60 names that repeat themselves after 60 years.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="4">Chaitra Sukla Pratipad is the day following 
  Amavasya immediately before the instant when the sun enters the Asvini nakshatra, 
  which is around April 14th. For example, in the year 1986, Chaitra sukla Pratipad 
  fell on April 10th. This marked the beginning of the lunar year akshaya. The 
  last day of the lunar year was on March 29th, 1987, which was phalguna Krishna 
  Amavasya (Amanta) or Chaitra Krishna Poornima (Poornimanta). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="4">That year had only 354 days. The lunar year 
  Vibhava started on March 18th, 1988 and ended on April 5th, 1989. The length 
  of the year was 384. This was due to the adddition of an adhika maasa after 
  Vaisakha. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0080" size="5">SOLAR CALENDAR</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="4">This system of calendar is based on the position 
  of the sun relative to the stars. As the sun moves along a circular path called 
  the ecliptic and it takes 365 1/4  days to complete one revolution. This period is 
  taken as the </font><font
color="#FF0080" size="4">solar year</font><font color="#000000" size="4">. In 
  the solar calendar, the year starts when the sun reaches a particular point 
  in the ecliptic which is a constellation of stars called </font><font color="#FF0080" size="4">Mesha</font><font

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><a name="solar"></a>This will be around April

  months, but to differentiate from them a prefix of</font><font color="#FF0080" size="4">
