<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Imagine yourself in an island. An island like the one Sindbad visits during his adventures, which is completely without a trace of human life. You are there right from your birth. You <BR>
don’t know about anything that you know now. You hunt for food, eat and then sleep. When you are leading a life like this, at some point you would realize the concept of <B><I>time</i></B>. Of course, not in terms of sec, min and hour as you know now. You would have observed that day and night occur at equal intervals. After some years you would also have observed that seasons repeat at equal intervals. So, by intuition would you not have these as basis or units to measure your time? </P>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>Thus the units for measuring time were acutally developed by </font><B><I><FONT FACE="Georgia, Times New Roman" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff00ff">observing nature.</font></i></B> </P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>
<P>You should always define some unit to measure anything. Metre is a unit to measure length. How do you define a metre? You have one scale in France. The length of this scale is taken as a metre. This is just an example of how you standardize and define units for measurements. </P>
<P>So how are we going to define our units of time? We shall use the behaviour and positions of celestial objects.</P>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>One </font><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff00ff">day</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> can be defined as the average time taken by the Sun to come back to the same position in the sky, as viewed from the earth. In other words, it is <I>the mean time period between two sunrises</I>. By now you should have known that the 'day' we are referring to is the 'Mean Solar Day'. The duration of this is 24 hours. Now, we've said that it is the <I>mean </I>time between two sunrises. Does it mean that the time between sunrises vary? Of course! While talking about seasons, we said that at the equinoxes the days and nights are equal. During summer solistice, the duration of day is at its maximum and during the winter the duration of night is at its maximum, and in the period in-between the duration of the day and the night varies. We've seen that the stars take about 23 hours and 56 minutes to come back to its same position. This duration is referred as 'Sidereal day'.</font></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><a name="timezone"></a>Thus, from the natural phenomenon 
  of sunrises, we can define the day and hour. An hour is obtained by dividing 
  the mean period between sunrises by 24. We say the time in terms of expressions 
  like 6'o clock in the morning, 3'o clock in the afternoon etc. How do we fix 
  this? Generally the time of sunrise is around 6'o clock in the morning and that 
  of sunset is 6'o clock in the night. But the time of sunrise and sunset differs 
  from place to place. To standardize them, we use the concept of </font><A HREF="latitudes.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>time 
  zones.</FONT></A></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Why do you have so many units (mm, cm, m, km etc…) for measurements? To measure something small you need a smaller unit and a larger unit to measure something large. You cannot say the distance from Chennai to Chicago in terms of mm and your height in km. </P>
<P>So we have defined one smaller unit of time (day). Click here to see how we define some larger units of time.</P>
